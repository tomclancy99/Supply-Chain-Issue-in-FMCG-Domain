Stacked bar charts comparing orders by city and product categories (Beverages, Dairy, Food).

Performance of top stores based on order counts.

OT % (On-Time %), IF % (In-Full %), OTIF % with gauges and targets.

Performance split for each city for OT, IF, and OTIF.

Insight:

OTIF % (combined metric)

Visuals:

Scatter Plot: Mapping stores based on OT% (x-axis) vs IF% (y-axis).

Heatmap Table: Displaying OT%, IF%, and OTIF% for all stores.

Insight:
Helps in benchmarking store performance, identifying both high-performing and underperforming stores, and prioritizing service optimization efforts.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Trend Analysis Dashboard
Purpose:
Visualizes temporal trends for key supply chain KPIs to monitor progress over time.

Metrics Tracked:

OT % (On-Time %)

IF % (In-Full %)

LIFR % (Line Item Fill Rate)

OTIF %

VOFR % (Volume Order Fill Rate)

Visuals:

Line Chart: Tracks OT % performance over months with a target threshold line.

Sankey Diagram: Represents OT% per month across cities (Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara).

Insight:
Detects seasonal or periodic fluctuations in operational KPIs and monitors whether performance targets are being met over time.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Order Lines at a Glance Dashboard
Purpose:
Breakdown of order lines performance across stores, focusing on Line Item Fill Rate (LIFR %).

Key Figures:

57K Total Order Lines

38K Fully Filled Order Lines

65.96% LIFR

96.59% VOFR

Visuals:

Bar charts showing Total Order Lines vs LIFR % by store.
